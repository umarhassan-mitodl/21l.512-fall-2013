## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course _21L.512 American Authors: Autobiography and Memoir_ as it was taught by Dr. Wyn Kelley in Fall 2013.

The course covered American authors and specifically focused on “life” when it is written down as autobiographies or memoirs. The course addressed the relationship between biography, autobiography, memoir, and between personal and social themes as well as considering how memory informs the present and why these works are so popular. The texts included classic authors and more recent examples.

## Course Outcomes

### Course Goals for Students

Some of the texts come very close to fiction or are fictional, but are still based on the author’s life. The goal of the class was to identify and discuss fact versus fiction using a series of fluid texts.
